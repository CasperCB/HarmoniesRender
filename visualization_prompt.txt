You will be given structured information about a game board composed of terrain stacks and animals. Your goal is to create a descriptive snapshot of the board from a top-down perspective.

Spatial Logic:
- The board uses hexagonal tiles arranged in a fixed grid. You may infer approximate directions (e.g., "northwest," "center," "southeast") based on coordinate clusters.
- Do **not** mention coordinates. Instead, describe **relative position**, **adjacency**, and **groupings** of terrain and animals.

Terrain Interpretation:
- Treat repeated terrain stacks (like "gray-gray" or "blue") as large natural features like **mountains**, **rivers**, **lakes**, **forests**, or **plains**. Stacks that start with "red" represent **buildings**.
- Stack height implies prominence — e.g., "gray-gray-gray" could be a tall mountain, while a single "green" tile may be a bush or grassy clearing.
- If terrain types cluster together, describe the **larger region** they form (e.g., “a winding river across the eastern side”).

Animal Placement:
- Use the listed animal locations to infer **habitat preference** and **placement** in the scene.
- If multiple animals of the same type are placed together or near a terrain feature, highlight their grouping or behavior (e.g., “llamas trekking along the ridgeline”).

Goal:
Write a vivid and immersive natural description of the board, as if helping an artist draw or paint the scene.
Focus on:
- The **shape and structure** of the land
- The **flow** of terrain features
- The **presence and placement** of animals
